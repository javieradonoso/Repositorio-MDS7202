    "## **MLFlow**\n",
    "\n",
    "`MLflow` es una plataforma de código abierto que simplifica la gestión y seguimiento de proyectos de aprendizaje automático. Con sus herramientas, los desarrolladores pueden organizar, rastrear y comparar experimentos, además de registrar modelos y controlar versiones.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "\n",
    "Si bien esta plataforma cuenta con un gran número de herramientas y funcionalidades, en este laboratorio trabajaremos con dos:\n",
    "1. **Runs**: Registro que constituye la información guardada tras la ejecución de un entrenamiento. Cada `run` tiene su propio run_id, el cual sirve como identificador para el entrenamiento en sí mismo. Dentro de cada `run` podremos acceder a información como los hiperparámetros utilizados, las métricas obtenidas, las librerías requeridas y hasta nos permite descargar el modelo entrenado.\n",
    "2. **Experiments**: Se utilizan para agrupar y organizar diferentes ejecuciones de modelos (`runs`). En ese sentido, un experimento puede agrupar 1 o más `runs`. De esta manera, es posible también registrar métricas, parámetros y archivos (artefactos) asociados a cada experimento.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Todo bien pero entonces, ¿cómo se usa en la práctica `MLflow`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Es sencillo! Considerando un problema de machine learning genérico, podemos registrar la información relevante del entrenamiento ejecutando `mlflow.autolog()` antes entrenar nuestro modelo. Veamos este bonito ejemplo facilitado por los mismos creadores de `MLflow`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!pip install mlflow\n",
    "import mlflow # importar mlflow\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n",
    "\n",
    "db = load_diabetes()\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and train models.\n",
    "rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "mlflow.autolog() # registrar automáticamente información del entrenamiento\n",
    "with mlflow.start_run(): # delimita inicio y fin del run\n",
    "    # aquí comienza el run\n",
    "    rf.fit(X_train, y_train) # train the model\n",
    "    predictions = rf.predict(X_test) # Use the model to make predictions on the test dataset.\n",
    "    # aquí termina el run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Si ustedes ejecutan el código anterior en sus máquinas locales (desde un jupyter notebook por ejemplo) se darán cuenta que en su directorio *root* se ha creado la carpeta `mlruns`. Esta carpeta lleva el tracking de todos los entrenamientos ejecutados desde el directorio root (importante: si se cambian de directorio y vuelven a ejecutar el código anterior, se creará otra carpeta y no tendrán acceso al entrenamiento anterior). Para visualizar estos entrenamientos, `MLflow` nos facilita hermosa interfaz visual a la que podemos acceder ejecutando:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mlflow ui\n",
    "```\n",

    "Comentarios sobre el uso de los recursos:\n",
    "- Uso de CPU  de un 0.36% es un uso muy bajo, lo que indica que el contenedor no está ejecutando procesos intensivos. Esto es esperable ya que la API solo consume CPU cuando procesa solicitudes.\n",
    "- Uso de Memoria (MEM USAGE / LIMIT) tiene 109.2 MiB de 3.827 GiB  lo cual es eficiente, considerando que el contenedor está ejecutando un servidor FastAPI con dependencias como pandas y xgboost. Esto demuestra que el contenedor es liviano en términos de memoria.\n",
    "-NET I/O es de 4.8 kB / 4.38 kB es muy bajo, lo que indica que apenas ha habido tráfico de red, probablemente por pruebas básicas de la API.\n",
    "- BLOCK I/O tiene un valor de 0 B / 541 kB sugiere que el contenedor ha realizado escrituras mínimas en el sistema de archivos, lo cual es común en contenedores que no tienen operaciones intensivas de almacenamiento.\n",

    "1. ¿Cómo se diferencia Docker de una máquina virtual (VM)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- En temas de arquitectura, Docker usa contenedores que comparten el kernel del sistema operativo del host. Mientras que la máquina virtual,  cada una tiene su propio sistema operativo completo junto con el kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Si comparamos el peso, Docker tiene contenedores que son ligeros porque no necesitan un SO completo, es decir, usan solo las dependencias requeridas. Mientras que las VMs son pesadas porque incluyen un SO completo y recursos virtualizados.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hablando de rendimiento, Docker tiene mejor rendimiento porque no hay hipervisor (virtualización de hardware). La VM tiene menor rendimiento debido a la sobrecarga del hipervisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ¿Cuál es la diferencia entre usar Docker y ejecutar la aplicación directamente en el sistema local?\n",
    "Docker:\n",
    "\t•\tOfrece un entorno aislado, evitando conflictos entre dependencias o versiones de paquetes.\n",
    "\t•\tPermite replicar el entorno en diferentes máquinas sin necesidad de configurarlo manualmente.\n",
    "\t•\tPuede contener librerías, configuraciones y archivos específicos, asegurando consistencia.\n",
    "\t•\tIdeal para despliegues y pruebas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ejecución Local:\n",
    "\t•\tDepende del sistema operativo y las configuraciones locales.\n",
    "\t•\tMayor riesgo de conflictos de dependencias si varias aplicaciones requieren versiones diferentes de librerías.\n",
    "\t•\tMás difícil de replicar el entorno exacto en otro sistema.\n",
    "\t•\tRequiere configuración manual y un mayor mantenimiento.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ¿Cómo asegura Docker la consistencia entre diferentes entornos de desarrollo y producción? \n",
    "\n",
    "Docker asegura la consistencia al utilizar imágenes inmutables que incluyen todas las dependencias y configuraciones necesarias para ejecutar una aplicación. Estas imágenes se pueden replicar en cualquier máquina con Docker instalado, eliminando las discrepancias entre entornos. Además, herramientas como docker-compose permiten configurar servicios complejos de manera uniforme, garantizando que todos los entornos (desarrollo, pruebas y producción) sean idénticos y funcionen de la misma manera.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ¿Cómo se gestionan los volúmenes en Docker para la persistencia de datos?\n",
    "\n",
    " Docker utiliza volúmenes para almacenar datos fuera del ciclo de vida de los contenedores, asegurando que los datos sean persistentes incluso si el contenedor se elimina o reinicia. Los volúmenes pueden ser anónimos, nombrados o utilizar bind mounts para mapear directorios del sistema host, lo que permite compartir datos entre contenedores y mantener la integridad de los datos en aplicaciones que requieren almacenamiento persistente.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ¿Qué son Dockerfile y docker-compose.yml, y cuál es su propósito?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dockerfile es un archivo que define las instrucciones para construir una imagen de Docker, especificando el entorno, dependencias y pasos necesarios para ejecutar una aplicación de manera consistente. Por otro lado, docker-compose.yml es un archivo de configuración que permite orquestar múltiples servicios (contenedores) de manera centralizada, definiendo cómo interactúan entre sí, sus redes, volúmenes y configuraciones, lo que simplifica el manejo de aplicaciones complejas que requieren varios componentes como bases de datos y servidores web."
