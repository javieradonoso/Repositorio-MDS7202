al realizar la función se pide investigar sobre algunos métodos y funciones de pandas, uno de ellos es `isna()` y `sum()`, el primero es un método en pandas que se utiliza para detectar valores nulos en un DataFrame o Serie, devolviendo un conjunto de valores booleanos donde `True` indica la presencia de un valor nulo. Por otro lado, `sum()` es un método de agregación que suma valores a lo largo de un eje en un DataFrame o Serie. Cuando se usa después de `isna()`, `sum()` cuenta la cantidad de valores nulos en cada columna o fila, dependiendo del eje especificado. \n","\n","Otra de las funciones que se pide investigar es `nunique()`, el cual se utiliza para contar el número de valores únicos en cada columna de un DataFrame o en una Serie. `nunique()` también permite especificar si se deben contar o no los valores nulos como parte de los valores únicos. \n","\n","Por último, `duplicated()`se utiliza para identificar filas duplicadas en un DataFrame, devolviendo una Serie booleana donde True indica que una fila es un duplicado de una anterior. El parámetro `subset` en `duplicated()` permite especificar una o más columnas a considerar al determinar si una fila es un duplicado. Al utilizar subset, se puede centrar la búsqueda de duplicados solo en las columnas relevantes, ignorando las demás.\n","\n","\n","\n","9. [ ] ¿Qué anomalías es posible observar de los datos que componen el DataFrame? ¿Existen valores nulos o duplicados?\n","\n","- Una de las anomalías encontradas es que se puede observar que hay 1400 filas en el DataFrame, sin embargo, solo se tienen 1153 valores únicos, mientras que se encuentran 247 valores duplicados. Por otro lado, es posible observar que se observan valores mayores a 100 y esto no debería ocurrir, puesto que dadas las indicaciones del enunciado, los valores de logro están entre un 0 y 100. \n","\n","- Por otra parte, en un principió se observó que las columnas de puntajes estaban determinadas como objetos, no en formato int o float, por lo que se decide pasar estas columnas a numéricas, y con ello, se observa que si existen datos nulos (anteriormente no se observaban datos nulos). También la columna de \"Test preparation course\" presenta en su gran mayoría valores nulos, esto quiere decir que para la mayoría de los estudiantes, no se tiene conocimientos sobre si dieron alguna prueba de preparación o al parecer no la dieron\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","10. [ ] Su compañero ChatGPT le provee un código para que pueda entender los resultados de las pruebas desde un gráfico. ¿Qué puede interpretar de la distribución de las notas en el boxplot?\n","\n","- En primer lugar, la distribución de los puntajes de matemáticas parece ligeramente sesgada hacia la izquierda (negativa), dado que la mediana está más cerca del cuartil superior de la caja. Esto indica que la mayoría de los estudiantes tienden a tener puntajes en el rango medio-alto, pero hay algunos que tienen puntajes más bajos. Mientras que en los puntajes de lecturas  parece más simétrica, con la mediana aproximadamente en el centro de la caja, lo que sugiere que los puntajes están más equilibrados en torno a la mediana. Por otro lado, los puntajes de escritura parecieran estar sesgada hacia la derecha (positiva), indicando que un mayor número de estudiantes tiene puntajes más altos.\n","\n","- La concentración de notas de los puntajes de matemáticas es más pequeña, lo que indica que los puntajes están más concentrados alrededor de la mediana, sugiriendo menor variabilidad en comparación con las otras asignaturas. En lectura y escritura, las cajas son más grandes, lo que indica una mayor dispersión de los puntajes, particularmente en escritura, donde hay una mayor variabilidad.\n","\n","- La presencia de outliers en las tres asignaturas indica que hay estudiantes cuyos puntajes se desvían considerablemente del resto. En matemáticas, los outliers están principalmente en el extremo inferior, lo que podría sugerir que algunos estudiantes les fue mal en esta asignatura. En lectura y escritura, hay outliers en ambos extremos, pero la escritura tiene más outliers en el extremo superior, lo que indica que algunos estudiantes tuvieron buenas notas en esta asignatura."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"3d074815f0ca4aa2b209d22862a746dd","deepnote_cell_height":193.1875,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"YJfqPXFZjQiA"},"source":["## 2 Limpieza de Datos [1.0 puntos]\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GM-alEw2FVE4"},"source":["<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img src=\"https://blogdatlas.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/datlas_mx_blog_limpieza_bds_data-scrubbing-service.gif\">\n","</p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"e2e475d0a8a04307868f13b96780b1a3","deepnote_cell_height":268.1875,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"syO5lHKvv6Wt"},"source":["En base a lo realizado anteriormente, realice una limpieza de los dataset.

Los estudiantes cuyos padres tienen un nivel educacional de “college” o “postgraduate” tienden a tener un GPA más alto en comparación con aquellos cuyos padres tienen solo “school” como nivel educativo. Además, dentro de cada nivel educacional, también se observan variaciones en el GPA entre los diferentes grupos étnicos. Por ejemplo, los estudiantes del “group B” consistentemente presentan un rango de GPA más alto en comparación con otros grupos étnicos, independientemente del nivel educacional de los padres.
